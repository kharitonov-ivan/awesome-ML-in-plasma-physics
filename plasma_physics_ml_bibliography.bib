  abstract      = {Nuclear fusion power delivered by magnetic-confinement tokamak reactors holds the promise of sustainable and clean energy1. The avoidance of large-scale plasma instabilities called disruptions within these reactors2,3 is one of the most pressing challenges4,5, because disruptions can halt power production and damage key components. Disruptions are particularly harmful for large burning-plasma systems such as the multibillion-dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project6 currently under construction, which aims to be the first reactor that produces more power from fusion than is injected to heat the plasma. Here we present a method based on deep learning for forecasting disruptions. Our method extends considerably the capabilities of previous strategies such as first-principles-based5 and classical machine-learning7--11 approaches. In particular, it delivers reliable predictions for machines other than the one on which it was trained---a crucial requirement for future large reactors that cannot afford training disruptions. Our approach takes advantage of high-dimensional training data to boost predictive performance while also engaging supercomputing resources at the largest scale to improve accuracy and speed. Trained on experimental data from the largest tokamaks in the United States (DIII-D12) and the world (Joint European Torus, JET13), our method can also be applied to specific tasks such as prediction with long warning times: this opens up the possibility of moving from passive disruption prediction to active reactor control and optimization. These initial results illustrate the potential for deep learning to accelerate progress in fusion-energy science and, more generally, in the understanding and prediction of complex physical systems.},

  abstract      = {We propose a novel flux-surface parameterization suitable for local MHD equilibrium calculations with strongly-shaped flux surfaces. The method is based on a systematic expansion in a small number of intuitive shape parameters, and reduces to the well-known Miller D-shaped parameterization in the limit where some of the coefficients are set to zero. The new parameterization is valid for up-down asymmetric plasmas and provides an improvement to the Miller form. Simultaneously, the method is rapidly convergent and requires only about half the number of shape parameters as a general Fourier representation in the pedestal.}

  abstract      = {We present an ultrafast neural network model, QLKNN, which predicts core tokamak transport heat and particle fluxes. QLKNN is a surrogate model based on a database of 3\hspace{0.167em}\texttimes{}\hspace{0.167em}108 flux calculations of the quasilinear gyrokinetic transport model, QuaLiKiz. The database covers a wide range of realistic tokamak core parameters. Physical features such as the existence of a critical gradient for the onset of turbulent transport were integrated into the neural network training methodology. We have coupled QLKNN to the tokamak modeling framework JINTRAC and rapid control-oriented tokamak transport solver RAPTOR. The coupled frameworks are demonstrated and validated through application to three JET shots covering a representative spread of H-mode operating space, predicting the turbulent transport of energy and particles in the plasma core. JINTRAC–QLKNN and RAPTOR–QLKNN are able to accurately reproduce JINTRAC–QuaLiKiz Ti,e and ne profiles, but 3–5 orders of magnitude faster. Simulations which take hours are reduced down to only a few tens of seconds. The discrepancy in the final source-driven predicted profiles between QLKNN and QuaLiKiz is on the order of 1\%–15\%. Also the dynamic behavior was well captured by QLKNN, with differences of only 4\%–10\% compared to JINTRAC–QuaLiKiz observed at mid-radius, for a study of density buildup following the L–H transition. Deployment of neural network surrogate models in multi-physics integrated tokamak modeling is a promising route toward enabling accurate and fast tokamak scenario optimization, uncertainty quantification, and control applications.},

Controlling tokamak plasmas in real time is essential to measure the plasma parameters in situ. However, the \ensuremath{\chi}2 method traditionally used in Thomson scattering diagnostics hampers real-time measurement due to the complexity of the calculations involved. In this study, we applied a neural network approach to Thomson scattering diagnostics in order to calculate the electron temperature, comparing the results to those obtained with the \ensuremath{\chi}2 method. The best results were obtained for 103 training cycles and eight nodes in the hidden layer. Our neural network approach shows good agreement with the \ensuremath{\chi}2 method and performs the calculation twenty times faster.},

  abstract      = {Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak {\`a}Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and `snowflake'configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained `droplets'on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.},

We investigate several classical supervised machine learning models to detect complete power detachment in the images captured by the Event Detection Intelligent Camera System (EDICAM) at the W7-X at each given image frame. In the dedicated detached state the plasma is stable despite its reduced contact with the machine walls and the radiation belt stays close to the separatrix, without exhibiting significant heat load onto the divertor. To decrease computational time and resources needed we propose certain pixel intensity profiles (or intensity values along lines) as the input to these models. After finding the profile that describes the images best in terms of detachment, we choose the best performing machine learning algorithm. It achieves an F1 score of 0.9836 on the training dataset and 0.9335 on the test set. Furthermore, we investigate its predictions in other scenarios, such as plasmas with substantially decreased minor radius and several magnetic configurations.},

  abstract      = {Generating energy from nuclear fusion in a tokamak may highly benefit from precise control of both kinetic and magnetic spatially-varying properties of the plasma (hot ionized gas where the fusion reactions take place). The spatial dependence of a plasma property, from the core to the edge of the plasma, is referred to as profile. Many control algorithms being developed require accurate, real-time knowledge of the plasma space-dependent state. However, many of the diagnostics used to measure the plasma state provide data that can be noisy or require significant post-processing. Within this context, an observer has been developed using an extended Kalman filtering approach for the electron temperature profile. The model employed by the observer uses a combination of analytical components and trained neural networks to generate as accurate of a prediction as possible while working within real-time calculation constraints. Such neural networks provide high accuracies, fast calculation times, and wide applicability. In addition, with only two diagnostic measurements at different spatial locations, the observer is able to estimate the entire electron temperature profile. Simulation results show that the observer can correctly estimate this profile despite significant discrepancies in the initial electron temperature profile and relatively high levels of noise. After its implementation in the plasma control system of the DIII-D tokamak, this observer may be able to provide valuable information on the electron temperature to a variety of present and future controllers.},

  abstract      = {This article reviews applications of Bayesian inference and machine learning (ML) in nuclear fusion research. Current and next-generation nuclear fusion experiments require analysis and modelling efforts that integrate different models consistently and exploit information found across heterogeneous data sources in an efficient manner. Model-based Bayesian inference provides a framework well suited for the interpretation of observed data given physics and probabilistic assumptions, also for very complex systems, thanks to its rigorous and straightforward treatment of uncertainties and modelling hypothesis. On the other hand, ML, in particular neural networks and deep learning models, are based on black-box statistical models and allow the handling of large volumes of data and computation very efficiently. For this reason, approaches which make use of ML and Bayesian inference separately and also in conjunction are of particular interest for today's experiments and are the main topic of this review. This article also presents an approach where physics-based Bayesian inference and black-box ML play along, mitigating each other's drawbacks: the former is made more efficient, the latter more interpretable.}

  abstract      = {The force-balanced state of magnetically confined plasmas heated up to 100 million degrees Celsius must be sustained long enough to achieve a burning-plasma state, such as in the case of ITER, a fusion reactor that promises a net energy gain. This force balance between the Lorentz force and the pressure gradient force, known as a plasma equilibrium, can be theoretically portrayed together with Maxwell's equations as plasmas are collections of charged particles. Nevertheless, identifying the plasma equilibrium in real time is challenging owing to its free-boundary and ill-posed conditions, which conventionally involves iterative numerical approach with a certain degree of subjective human decisions such as including or excluding certain magnetic measurements to achieve numerical convergence on the solution as well as to avoid unphysical solutions. Here, we introduce GS-DeepNet, which learns plasma equilibria through solely unsupervised learning, without using traditional numerical algorithms. GS-DeepNet includes two neural networks and teaches itself. One neural network generates a possible candidate of an equilibrium following Maxwell's equations and is taught by the other network satisfying the force balance under the equilibrium. Measurements constrain both networks. Our GS-DeepNet achieves reliable equilibria with uncertainties in contrast with existing methods, leading to possible better control of fusion-grade plasmas.},

  abstract      = {Tokamaks are the most promising way for nuclear fusion reactors. Disruption in tokamaks is a violent event that terminates a confined plasma and causes unacceptable damage to the device. Machine learning models have been widely used to predict incoming disruptions. However, future reactors, with much higher stored energy, cannot provide enough unmitigated disruption data at high performance to train the predictor before damaging themselves. Here we apply a deep parameter-based transfer learning method in disruption prediction. We train a model on the J-TEXT tokamak and transfer it, with only 20 discharges, to EAST, which has a large difference in size, operation regime, and configuration with respect to J-TEXT. Results demonstrate that the transfer learning method reaches a similar performance to the model trained directly with EAST using about 1900 discharge. Our results suggest that the proposed method can tackle the challenge in predicting disruptions for future tokamaks like ITER with knowledge learned from existing tokamaks.},

BES-ELMnet has convolutional and fully-connected layers, taking two-dimensional plasma fluctuations with a temporal window of size 128\hspace{0.167em}\mathrm{\mu}s and generating a scalar output which can be interpreted as a probability of the upcoming ELM onset. As approximately labeled inter-ELM broadband () fluctuations are given to the network, BES-ELMnet learns by itself ELM-related precursors arising before the onsets through supervised learning scheme. BES-ELMnet achieves the gradually increasing ELM onset probabilities between two consecutive ELMs during the inter-ELM phases and can forecast the first ELM onsets which occur after the high confinement mode transition. We further investigate the network generality in terms of the selected frequency band to ensure the use of BES-ELMnet for various operation regimes without changing the trained architecture. Therefore, our novel prediction method will enhance a proactive high confinement mode control of fusion-grade plasmas.}

In general, ST-FNO represents an efficient and accurate machine learning surrogate for numerical simulators for multi-variable nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations, with the proposed architectures and loss functions. The efficacy of ST-FNO has been demonstrated using quiescent H-mode simulation data from NIMROD and kink-mode simulation data from GTC. The ST-FNO H-mode results show orders of magnitude reduction in memory and central processing unit usage in comparison with the numerical solvers in NIMROD when computing fields over a selected poloidal plane. The ST-FNO kink-mode results achieve a factor of 2 reduction in the number of parameters compared to baseline FNO models without accuracy loss.},

Notably, the computational speed of these models has been significantly increased, surpassing traditional methods by over tenfold. Furthermore, the investigation of input data range and error prediction serves as the foundation for future automated calculation process.

  title         = {Physics-informed neural networks for the modelling of interferometer-polarimetry in tokamak multi-diagnostic equilibrium reconstructions},
  journal       = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
  abstract      = {Equilibrium reconstruction is crucial in nuclear fusion and plasma physics, as it enables the understanding of the distribution of fundamental plasma quantities within a reactor. Given that equilibrium reconstruction is an ill-posed problem, it is essential to constrain the algorithm with multiple diagnostics to achieve accurate results. Among these, the interferometer-polarimeter is one of the most valuable diagnostics for constraining equilibrium reconstruction, as it provides line-integrated information about the internal magnetic fields. However, the polarisation evolution of an electromagnetic wave traversing a magnetised plasma exhibits non-linear behaviour, making it challenging to incorporate polarimeter data into the reconstruction process. This difficulty often leads to the use of a linear approximation, known as the type-I approximation, in the inversion algorithm. Unfortunately, this approximation can significantly limit the accuracy of the reconstructions in many cases. In this work, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) algorithm for reconstructing plasma equilibrium using a multi-diagnostic approach that includes magnetics, Thomson scattering, and interferometer-polarimeter data. The PINN algorithm employs three models for reconstruction: the first uses the type-I approximation, the second uses the non-linear polarization equation under the cold-plasma approximation, and the third uses a comprehensive model that accounts for thermal effects, both relativistic and non-relativistic (defined as the hot plasma model). Parametric analyses conducted on synthetic cases demonstrate that the hot plasma model consistently yields the best results, while reconstructions using the type-I or cold plasma approximations are prone to systematic errors in the reconstructed plasma quantities. The PINN model has been tested on ITER-like plasma configurations with noisy measurements, showing that the inclusion of interferometer-polarimeter data significantly improves accuracy, achieving around 99.9\%. Future work aims to transfer the algorithm to existing experimental nuclear fusion reactors and to integrate additional diagnostics for further enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the solutions.}

In this FDM approach, typically over O(105) time steps are needed for a single discharge, to mitigate numerical instabilities induced by stiff transport coefficients. It requires significant computing time as costly transport models are repeatedly called in a serial manner, proportional to the number of time steps. Additionally, the unidirectional calculations of FDM make it difficult to predict regions prior to the initial condition or apply additional temporal constraints. In this study, we discuss using a new scheme to solve plasma transport based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). PINN iteratively updates a function that maps spatiotemporal coordinates to plasma states, gradually reducing errors in transport equations. The required number of updates in PINNs is several orders of magnitude less than the chronological iterations in FDM. Furthermore, it is free from numerical instabilities arising from finite grids and enables more versatile semi-predictive simulations with arbitrary spatiotemporal constraints. In this paper, we discuss the features and potentials of the tokamak transport solver using PINNs through comparisons with FDM, and also its drawbacks and challenges.}

An Area Under receiver-operator characteristic Curve of 0.940 has been realized offline over a test campaign involving 72 disruptive and 240 non-disruptive shots, despite the limited training data available from the initial two campaigns. In addition to the well-documented challenge of insufficient training data, a previously unanticipated issue is addressed that the data distribution of a new device is continuously drifting. The plasma scans across a broad parameter space, bringing a drifting distribution of disruption causes and diagnostic data. This problem is often overlooked in previous implementations on steadily operating tokamaks, necessitating greater attention in future tokamaks like ITER. To address these challenges, innovative modules including predict-first neural network, data augmentation, and pseudo data placeholders are developed and implemented, which promotes the accuracy by up to 20\%. A series of advantages are also brought by the modules, including the robustness in handling missing input channels, and the interpretability to identify which parameter of plasma is under abnormal condition. The results demonstrate that, with dedicated data collection and algorithm implementation, the issues of limited data and drifting distribution can be overcome, and further, the deep learning-based algorithm can reliably provide disruption alarms on a new tokamak.}

  abstract      = {A deep neural network is developed and trained on magnetic measurements (input) and EFIT poloidal magnetic flux (output) on the EAST tokamak. In optimizing the network architecture, we use automatic optimization to search for the best hyperparameters, which helps in better model generalization. We compare the inner magnetic surfaces and last-closed-flux surfaces with those from EFIT. We also calculated the normalized internal inductance, which is completely determined by the poloidal magnetic flux and can further reflect the accuracy of the prediction. The time evolution of the internal inductance in full discharge is compared with that provided by EFIT. All of the comparisons show good agreement, demonstrating the accuracy of the machine learning model, which has high spatial resolution compared with the off-line EFIT while still meeting the time constraint of real-time control.},

  abstract      = {For stable and efficient fusion energy production using a tokamak reactor, it is essential to maintain a high-pressure hydrogenic plasma without plasma disruption. Therefore, it is necessary to actively control the tokamak based on the observed plasma state, to manoeuvre high-pressure plasma while avoiding tearing instability, the leading cause of disruptions. This presents an obstacle-avoidance problem for which artificial intelligence based on reinforcement learning has recently shown remarkable performance1--4. However, the obstacle here, the tearing instability, is difficult to forecast and is highly prone to terminating plasma operations, especially in the ITER baseline scenario. Previously, we developed a multimodal dynamic model that estimates the likelihood of future tearing instability based on signals from multiple diagnostics and actuators5. Here we harness this dynamic model as a training environment for reinforcement-learning artificial intelligence, facilitating automated instability prevention. We demonstrate artificial intelligence control to lower the possibility of disruptive tearing instabilities in DIII-D6, the largest magnetic fusion facility in the United States. The controller maintained the tearing likelihood under a given threshold, even under relatively unfavourable conditions of low safety factor and low torque. In particular, it allowed the plasma to actively track the stable path within the time-varying operational space while maintaining H-mode performance, which was challenging with traditional preprogrammed control. This controller paves the path to developing stable high-performance operational scenarios for future use in ITER.},

  abstract      = {Fusion power production in tokamaks uses discharge configurations that risk producing strong type I edge localized modes. The largest of these modes will likely increase impurities in the plasma and potentially damage plasma facing components, such as the protective heat and particle divertor. Machine learning-based prediction and control may provide for the automatic detection and mitigation of these damaging modes before they grow too large to suppress. To that end, large labeled datasets are required for the supervised training of machine learning models. We present an algorithm that achieves 97.7\% precision when automatically labeling edge localized modes in the large DIII-D tokamak discharge database. The algorithm has no user controlled parameters and is largely robust to tokamak and plasma configuration changes. This automatically labeled database of events can subsequently feed future training of machine learning models aimed at autonomous edge localized mode control and suppression.},

  abstract      = {Generative deep learning techniques are employed in a novel framework for the construction of surrogate models capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of 2D plasma turbulence. The proposed Generative Artificial Intelligence Turbulence (GAIT) framework enables the acceleration of turbulence simulations for long-time transport studies. GAIT leverages a convolutional variational auto-encoder and a recurrent neural network to generate new turbulence data from existing simulations, extending the time horizon of transport studies with minimal computational cost. The application of the GAIT framework to plasma turbulence using the Hasegawa–Wakatani (HW) model is presented, evaluating its performance via various analyses. Very good agreement is found between the GAIT and the HW models in the spatiotemporal Fourier and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition spectra, the flow topology characterized by the Okubo–Weiss parameter, and the time autocorrelation function of turbulent fluctuations. Excellent agreement has also been obtained in the probability distribution function of particle displacements and the effective turbulent diffusivity. In-depth analyses of the latent space of turbulent states, choice of hyperparameters and alternative deep learning models for the time prediction are presented. Our results highlight the potential of Artificial Intelligence-based surrogate models to overcome the computational challenges in turbulence simulation, which can be extended to other situations such as geophysical fluid dynamics.},

  abstract      = {The tokamak offers a promising path to fusion energy, but disruptions pose a major economic risk, motivating solutions to manage their consequence. This work develops a reinforcement learning approach to this problem by training a policy to ramp-down the plasma current while avoiding limits on a number of quantities correlated with disruptions. The policy training environment is a hybrid physics and machine learning model trained on simulations of the SPARC primary reference discharge (PRD) ramp-down, an upcoming burning plasma scenario which we use as a testbed. To address physics uncertainty and model inaccuracies, the simulation is massively parallelized on GPU with randomized physics parameters during policy training. The trained policy is then run in feedback on a transport simulator as a demonstration. We also directly address the crucial issue of control validation by demonstrating that a constraint-conditioned policy can be a trajectory design assistant that designs a library of feed-forward trajectories to handle different physics conditions and user constraint settings, a promising approach for the sensitive context of burning plasma tokamaks. Finally, we demonstrate that the training environment can be a useful platform for feed-forward optimization approaches by optimizing feed-forward trajectories that are robust to physics uncertainty.},

  abstract      = {We present a semi-automated algorithm for designing three-dimensional divertor or limiter plates targeting low heat loads. The algorithm designs the plates in two stages: firstly, the parallel heat flux distribution is caught on vertically-inclined plates at one or several toroidal locations. Secondly, the power per unit area is reduced by stretching, tilting and bending the plates toroidally. Heat transport is modelled using the EMC3-Lite code, which uses an anisotropic diffusion model. We apply this scheme to HSX, a medium-sized stellarator located at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Starting from the current machine with an extended vessel wall, we construct plates which are able to effectively catch and spread the heat for three different magnetic configurations. The scheme has a computational cost in the order of tens of CPU-minutes, making it a powerful tool for semi-automated plasma-facing component design in three-dimensional environments.}

  abstract      = {Fluid-based scrape-off layer transport codes, such as UEDGE, are heavily utilized in tokamak analysis and design, but typically require user-specified anomalous transport coefficients to match experiments. Determining the uniqueness of these parameters and the uncertainties in them to match experiments can provide valuable insights to fusion scientists. We leverage recent work in the area of likelihood-free inference (`simulation-based inference') to train a neural network, which enables accurate statistical inference of the anomalous transport coefficients given experimental plasma profile input. UEDGE is treated as a black-box simulator and runs multiple times with anomalous transport coefficients sampled from priors, and the neural network is trained on these simulations to emulate the posterior. The neural network is trained as a normalizing flow model for density estimation, allowing it to accurately represent complicated, high-dimensional distribution functions. With a fixed simulation budget, we compare a single-round procedure to a multi-round approach that guides the training simulations toward a specific target observation. We discuss the future possibilities for use of amortized models, which train on a wide range of simulations and enable fast statistical inference for results during experiments.}

  abstract      = {The tokamak approach, utilizing a toroidal magnetic field configuration to confine a hot plasma, is one of the most promising designs for developing reactors that can exploit nuclear fusion to generate electrical energy1,2. To reach the goal of an economical reactor, most tokamak reactor designs3--10 simultaneously require reaching a plasma line-averaged density above an empirical limit---the so-called Greenwald density11---and attaining an energy confinement quality better than the standard high-confinement mode12,13. However, such an operating regime has never been verified in experiments. In addition, a long-standing challenge in the high-confinement mode has been the compatibility between a high-performance core and avoiding large, transient edge perturbations that can cause very high heat loads on the plasma-facing-components in tokamaks. Here we report the demonstration of stable tokamak plasmas with a line-averaged density approximately 20{\%} above the Greenwald density and an energy confinement quality of approximately 50{\%} better than the standard high-confinement mode, which was realized by taking advantage of the enhanced suppression of turbulent transport granted by high density-gradients in the high-poloidal-beta scenario14,15. Furthermore, our experimental results show an integration of very low edge transient perturbations with the high normalized density and confinement core. The operating regime we report supports some critical requirements in many fusion reactor designs all over the world and opens a potential avenue to an operating point for producing economically attractive fusion energy.},
