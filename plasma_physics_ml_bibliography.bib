                   Learning (DRL) to optimize the design of a nuclear fusion
                   reactor. DRL can efficiently address the challenging issues
                   attributed to multiple physics and engineering constraints
                   for steady-state operation. The fusion reactor design
                   computation and the optimization code applicable to
                   parallelization with DRL are developed. The proposed
                   framework enables finding the optimal reactor design that
                   satisfies the operational requirements while reducing
                   building costs. Multi-objective design optimization for a
                   fusion reactor is now simplified by DRL, indicating the high

               obtained for the development of machine learning surrogate models
               for detachment control. For the current 2D data set, three
               control parameters are varied: gas puff rate, power input and
               impurity fraction. In addition, the values of the perpendicular
               anomalous transport coefficients are scanned because they are the
               most important uncertainty input of UEDGE or other 2D transport
               codes. The range of the parameters covers the normal experimental
               control range. A spatial constant concentration of impurities
               (fixed-fraction) is assumed, and currents for solving electric
               potential and cross-field drifts are included since they are
               important in determining divertor plasma states. Compared to our
               previous work of building a large data set of 1D UEDGE
               simulations [1] that already captures the main SOL physics by
               solving plasma parallel transport equations in a flux tube with
               recycled atom neutrals, these 2D simulations have higher fidelity
               by including cross-field drifts and the uncertainty of
               perpendicular transport coefficients, which provides 2D plasma
               states toward both inner and outer target plates. The data set
               shows that for a certain power input and impurity fraction, the
               target plate ion saturation current roll-over appears as the puff
               rate increases, recovering the trend of experimental data.
               However, the roll-over appears earlier (at a smaller upstream
               density) than the results of our previous 1D simulations due to
               higher radiation. A surrogate model is under development using
               the 2D UEDGE simulations for detachment control [2]. Possible
               extensions of including geometry effects: varying divertor leg
               lengths and divertor target tilt angles, will also be discussed.

                   (NN) trained on a dataset of 1865 time slices from operation
                   of the DIII-D tokamak using extreme ultraviolet / vacuum
                   ultraviolet (EUV/VUV) emission spectroscopy matched with
                   high-accuracy divertor Thomson scattering measurements of the
                   electron temperature, $T_e$. This NN is shown to be
                   particularly good at predicting $T_e$ at low temperatures
                   ($T_e < 10$ eV) where the NN demonstrated a mean average
                   error of less than 1 eV. Trained to detect plasma detachment
                   in the tokamak divertor, a NN classifier was able to
                   correctly identify detached states ($T_e<5$ eV) with a 99\%
                   accuracy (F$_1$ score of 0.96) at an acquisition rate
                   $10\times$ faster than the Thomson scattering measurement.
                   The performance of the model is understood by examining a set
                   of 4800 theoretical spectra generated using collisional
                   radiative modeling that was also used to predict the

                   Our approach involves constructing and training two neural
                   networks. An autoencoder that finds a proper latent space
                   representation (LSR) of plasma state by compressing the

                   plasma control parameters to its corresponding LSR. By
                   combining the forward model and the decoder network from
                   autoencoder, this new data-driven surrogate model is able to
                   predict a consistent set of diagnostic measurements based on
                   a few plasma control parameters. In order to ensure that the
                   crucial detachment physics is correctly captured, highly
                   efficient 1D UEDGE model is used to generate training and
                   validation data in this study. Benchmark between the
                   data-driven surrogate model and UEDGE simulations shows that
                   our surrogate model is capable to provide accurate detachment
                   prediction (usually within a few percent relative error
                   margin) but with at least four orders of magnitude speed-up,
                   indicating that performance-wise, it has the potential to
                   facilitate integrated tokamak design and plasma control.
                   Comparing to the widely used two-point model and/or two-point
                   model formatting, the new data-driven model features
                   additional detachment front prediction and can be easily
                   extended to incorporate richer physics. This study
                   demonstrates that the complicated divertor and
                   scrape-off-layer plasma state has a low-dimensional
                   representation in latent space. Understanding plasma dynamics

               (NN) surrogates have been used to accelerate these calculations

               This paper extends a previous NN model, known as QLKNN-hyper-10D,
               by incorporating the impact of impurities, plasma rotation, and
               magnetic equilibrium effects. This is achieved by adding a light
               impurity fractional density (nimp,light/ne) and its normalized
               gradient, the normalized pressure gradient ($\alpha$), the
               toroidal Mach number (Mtor), and the normalized toroidal flow
               velocity gradient. The input space was sampled based on
               experimental data from the JET tokamak to avoid the curse of
               dimensionality. The resulting networks, named QLKNN-jetexp-15D,
               show good agreement with the original QuaLiKiz model, both by
               comparing individual transport quantity predictions and by
               comparing its impact within the integrated model, JINTRAC. The
               profile-averaged RMS of the integrated modeling simulations is
               <10\% for each of the five scenarios tested. This is non-trivial
               given the potential numerical instabilities present within the

               QLKNN-jetexp-15D resulted in a speed increase of only 60--100 as

               may put at risk the integrity of a tokamak. However, the physical
               phenomena leading to disruptions are very complex and non-linear
               and therefore no satisfactory model has been devised so far

               machine learning techniques have been extensively pursued in the
               last years. In this paper a real-time predictor specifically
               developed for JET and based on support vector machines is
               presented. The main aim of the present investigation is to obtain
               high recognition rates in a real-time simulated environment. To
               this end the predictor has been tested on the time slices of
               entire discharges exactly as in real world operation. Since the
               year 2000, the experiments at JET have been organized in
               campaigns named sequentially beginning with campaign C1. In this
               paper results from campaign C1 (year 2000) and up to C19 (year
               2007) are reported. The predictor has been trained with data from
               JET's campaigns up to C7 with particular attention to reducing
               the number of missed alarms, which are less than 1\%, for a test
               set of discharges from the same campaigns used for the training.
               The false alarms plus premature alarms are of the order of 6.4\%,
               for a total success rate of more than 92\%. The robustness of the
               predictor has been proven by testing it with a wide subset of
               shots of more recent campaigns (from C8 to C19) without any
               retraining. The success rate over the period between C8 and C14
               is on average 88\% and never falls below 82\%, confirming the
               good generalization capabilities of the developed technique.
               After C14, significant modifications were implemented on JET and
               its diagnostics and consequently the success rates of the
               predictor between C15 and C19 decays to an average of 79\%.
               Finally, the performance of the developed detection system has
               been compared with the predictions of the JET protection system
               (JPS). The new predictor clearly outperforms JPS up to about 180
               ms before the disruptions.",

  abstract = "Fusion in a magnetically confined plasma is still in the realm of
              fundamental research: in addition to the necessary progress in our
              theoretical knowledge, the operation of current tokamaks remains
              delicate, as it requires substantial human effort each time a new
              experimental scenario is developed. Moreover, the usual
              combination of linear feedback and feedforward control is not very
              robust with respect to the non-linear behavior of plasma dynamics.
              The overall approach is then not compatible with the reliability
              of a future reactor, and a better control of the plasma is
              necessary through control algorithms using more theoretical or
              empirical knowledge. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
              demonstrated its usefulness in many fields, notably tokamak
              control. By trial-and-error, an agent interacts on an environment,
              to learn a behavioral policy maximizing a reward which formalizes
              the overall objectives. Paired with neural networks, deep
              reinforcement learning becomes a suitable candidate to fulfill
              these high-dimensional, uncertain and non-linear situations. This
              thesis aims at applying and extending the said methods on the WEST
              tokamak, with the development of a general framework to train an
              agent on a free-boundary equilibrium solver, which simulates the
              magnetic equilibrium and core profiles evolution. Magnetic
              feedback control of plasma's shape, position, and current is
              achieved on multiple control scenarios, with training times
              significantly reduced by the use of curriculum learning. Several
              procedures are discussed, not only to enhance generalization
              within the operational domain of the WEST real-time control
              system, but also to explore the robustness of RL agents against
              disturbances and plasma uncertainties. The obtained results offer
              many perspectives in favor of reinforcement learning and
              artificial intelligence for routine use in the operations of a
              magnetically confined fusion device. The inherent connections
              drawn between RL and classical control are studied, and could lead
              to a more interpretable use of neural networks as powerful and
              robust policies, potentially able to manage more actuators and
              objectives during long plasma discharges.",

  abstract  = "Stable, high-performance operation of a tokamak requires several
               plasma control problems to be handled simultaneously. Moreover,
               the complex physics which governs the tokamak plasma evolution
               must be studied and understood to make correct choices in

               merged, using control solutions as experimental tool for physics
               studies, and using physics knowledge for developing new advanced
               control solutions. The TCV tokamak at CRPP-EPFL is ideally placed
               to explore issues at the interface between plasma physics and
               plasma control, by combining a state-of-the-art digital real-time
               control system with a flexible and powerful set of actuators, in
               particular the electron cyclotron heating and current drive
               system (ECRH/ECCD). This unique experimental platform has been
               used to develop and test new control strategies for three
               important and reactor-relevant tokamak plasma physics
               instabilities, including the sawtooth, the edge localized mode
               (ELM) and the neoclassical tearing mode (NTM). These control
               strategies offer new possibilities for fusion plasma control and
               at the same time facilitate studies of the physics of the
               instabilities with greater precision and detail in a controlled
               environment. The period of the sawtooth crash, a periodic MHD
               instability in the core of a tokamak plasma, can be varied by
               localized deposition of ECRH/ECCD near the q = 1 surface, where q
               is the safety factor. Exploiting this known physical phenomenon,
               a sawtooth pacing controller was developed which is able to
               precisely control the time of appearance of the next sawtooth
               crash. It was also shown that each individual sawtooth period can
               be controlled in real-time. A similar scheme is applied to H-mode
               plasmas with type-I ELMs, where it is shown that pacing
               regularizes the ELM period. The regular, reproducible and
               therefore predictable sawtooth crashes obtained by the sawtooth
               pacing controller have been used to study the relationship
               between sawteeth and NTMs. It is known that post-crash MHD
               activity can provide the ``seed'' island for an NTM, which then
               grows under its neoclassical bootstrap drive. Experiments are
               shown which demonstrate that the seeding of 3/2 NTMs by long
               sawtooth crashes can be avoided by preemptive, crash-synchronized
               EC power injection pulses at the q = 3/2 rational surface
               location. NTM stabilization experiments in which the ECRH
               deposition location is moved in real-time with steerable mirrors
               have shown effective stabilization of both 3/2 and 2/1 NTMs, and
               have precisely localized the deposition location that is most
               effective. Studies of current-profile driven destabilization of
               tearing modes in TCV plasmas with significant amounts of ECCD
               show a great sensitivity to details of the current profile, but
               failed to identify a stationary region in the parameter space in
               which NTMs are always destabilized. This suggests that transient
               effects intrinsically play a role. Next to instability control,
               the simultaneous control of magnetic and kinetic plasma profiles
               is another key requirement for advanced tokamak operation. While
               control of kinetic plasma profiles around an operating point can
               be handled using standard linear control techniques, the strongly
               nonlinear physics of the coupled profiles complicates the problem
               significantly. Even more, since internal magnetic quantities are
               difficult to measure with sufficient spatial and temporal
               resolution --even after years of diagnostic development-- routine
               control of tokamak plasma profiles remains a daunting and
               extremely challenging task. In this thesis, a model-based
               approach is used in which physics understanding of plasma current
               and energy transport is embedded in the control solution. To this
               aim, a new lightweight transport code has been derived focusing
               on simplicity and speed of simulation, which is compatible with
               the demands for real-time control. This code has been named
               RAPTOR (RApid Plasma Transport simulatOR). In a first-of-its-kind
               application, the partial differential equation for current
               diffusion is solved in real-time during a plasma shot in the TCV
               control system using RAPTOR. This concept is known in control
               terms as a state observer, and it is applied experimentally to
               the tokamak current density profile problem for the first time.
               The real-time simulation gives a physics-model-based estimate of
               key plasma quantities, to be controlled or monitored in real-time
               by different control systems. Any available diagnostics can be
               naturally included into the real-time simulation providing
               additional constraints and removing measurement uncertainties.
               The real-time simulation approach holds the advantage that
               knowledge of the plasma profiles is no longer restricted to those
               points in space and time where they are measured by a diagnostic,
               but that an estimate for any quantity can be computed at any
               time. This includes estimates of otherwise unmeasurable
               quantities such as the loop voltage profile or the bootstrap
               current distribution. In a first closed-loop experiment, an
               estimate of the internal inductance resulting from the real-time
               simulation is feedback controlled, independently from the plasma
               central temperature, by an appropriate mix of co- and counter-
               ECCD. As a tokamak plasma evolves from one state to another
               during plasma ramp-up or ramp-down, the profile trajectories must
               stay within a prescribed operational envelope delimited by
               physics instabilities and engineering constraints. Determining
               the appropriate actuator command sequence to navigate this
               operational space has traditionally been a trial-and-error
               procedure based on experience of tokamak physics operators. A
               computational technique is developed based on the RAPTOR code
               which can calculate these trajectories based on the profile
               transport physics model, by solving an open-loop optimal control
               problem. The solution of this problem is greatly aided by the
               fact that the code returns the plasma state trajectory
               sensitivities to input trajectory parameters, a functionality
               which is unique to RAPTOR. This information can also be used to
               construct linearized models around the optimal trajectory, and to
               determine the active constraint, which can be used for
               time-varying closed-loop controller design. This
               physics-model-based approach has shown excellent results and
               holds great potential for application in other tokamaks worldwide
               as well as in future devices.",

               enables accurate statistical inference of the anomalous transport

               the parallel heat flux distribution is caught on
               vertically-inclined plates at one or several toroidal locations.
               Secondly, the power per unit area is reduced by stretching,
               tilting and bending the plates toroidally. Heat transport is
               modelled using the EMC3-Lite code, which uses an anisotropic
               diffusion model. We apply this scheme to HSX, a medium-sized

               Starting from the current machine with an extended vessel wall,
               we construct plates which are able to effectively catch and
               spread the heat for three different magnetic configurations. The

               trained on simulations of the SPARC primary reference discharge
               (PRD) ramp-down, an upcoming burning plasma scenario which we use

               to manoeuvre high-pressure plasma while avoiding tearing
               instability, the leading cause of disruptions. This presents an

               based on reinforcement learning has recently shown remarkable
               performance1-4. However, the obstacle here, the tearing
               instability, is difficult to forecast and is highly prone to
               terminating plasma operations, especially in the ITER baseline
               scenario. Previously, we developed a multimodal dynamic model
               that estimates the likelihood of future tearing instability based

                   suppress this instability and avoid energy busts damaging the
                   device. Unfortunately, the conventional use of the 3D field
                   in tokamaks typically leads to degraded fusion performance
                   and an increased risk of other plasma instabilities, two
                   severe issues for reactor implementation. In this work, we
                   present an innovative 3D field optimization, exploiting
                   machine learning, real-time adaptability, and multi-device
                   capabilities to overcome these limitations. This integrated
                   scheme is successfully deployed on DIII-D and KSTAR tokamaks,
                   consistently achieving reactor-relevant core confinement and
                   the highest fusion performance without triggering damaging
                   instabilities or bursts while demonstrating ITER-relevant
                   automated 3D optimization for the first time. This is enabled
                   both by advances in the physics understanding of
                   self-organized transport in the plasma edge and by advances
                   in machine-learning technology, which is used to optimize the
                   3D field spectrum for automated management of a volatile and
                   complex system. These findings establish real-time adaptive
                   3D field optimization as a crucial tool for ITER and future
                   reactors to maximize fusion performance while simultaneously

               realized offline over a test campaign involving 72 disruptive and
               240 non-disruptive shots, despite the limited training data
               available from the initial two campaigns. In addition to the
               well-documented challenge of insufficient training data, a
               previously unanticipated issue is addressed that the data
               distribution of a new device is continuously drifting. The plasma
               scans across a broad parameter space, bringing a drifting
               distribution of disruption causes and diagnostic data. This
               problem is often overlooked in previous implementations on
               steadily operating tokamaks, necessitating greater attention in
               future tokamaks like ITER. To address these challenges,
               innovative modules including predict-first neural network (PFNN),
               data augmentation, and pseudo data placeholders are developed and
               implemented, which promotes the accuracy by up to 20\%. A series
               of advantages are also brought by the modules, including the
               robustness in handling missing input channels, and the
               interpretability to identify which parameter of plasma is under
               abnormal condition. The results demonstrate that, with dedicated
               data collection and algorithm implementation, the issues of
               limited data and drifting distribution can be overcome, and
               further, the deep learning-based algorithm can reliably provide

               the finite difference method (FDM), a relatively simple scheme to
               solve the transport equations, a coupled set of time-dependent
               partial differential equations. In this FDM approach, typically
               over O(105) time steps are needed for a single discharge, to
               mitigate numerical instabilities induced by stiff transport
               coefficients. It requires significant computing time as costly
               transport models are repeatedly called in a serial manner,
               proportional to the number of time steps. Additionally, the
               unidirectional calculations of FDM make it difficult to predict
               regions prior to the initial condition or apply additional

               PINNs is several orders of magnitude less than the chronological
               iterations in FDM. Furthermore, it is free from numerical
               instabilities arising from finite grids and enables more

               distribution of fundamental plasma quantities within a reactor.
               Given that equilibrium reconstruction is an ill-posed problem, it
               is essential to constrain the algorithm with multiple diagnostics
               to achieve accurate results. Among these, the
               interferometer-polarimeter is one of the most valuable
               diagnostics for constraining equilibrium reconstruction, as it
               provides line-integrated information about the internal magnetic
               fields. However, the polarisation evolution of an electromagnetic
               wave traversing a magnetised plasma exhibits non-linear
               behaviour, making it challenging to incorporate polarimeter data
               into the reconstruction process. This difficulty often leads to
               the use of a linear approximation, known as the type-I
               approximation, in the inversion algorithm. Unfortunately, this
               approximation can significantly limit the accuracy of the
               reconstructions in many cases. In this work, we present a
               physics-informed neural network (PINN) algorithm for
               reconstructing plasma equilibrium using a multi-diagnostic
               approach that includes magnetics, Thomson scattering, and
               interferometer-polarimeter data. The PINN algorithm employs three
               models for reconstruction: the first uses the type-I
               approximation, the second uses the non-linear polarization
               equation under the cold-plasma approximation, and the third uses
               a comprehensive model that accounts for thermal effects, both
               relativistic and non-relativistic (defined as the hot plasma
               model). Parametric analyses conducted on synthetic cases
               demonstrate that the hot plasma model consistently yields the
               best results, while reconstructions using the type-I or cold
               plasma approximations are prone to systematic errors in the
               reconstructed plasma quantities. The PINN model has been tested
               on ITER-like plasma configurations with noisy measurements,
               showing that the inclusion of interferometer-polarimeter data
               significantly improves accuracy, achieving around 99.9\%. Future

               motivating example of this thesis, determining the next state for
               a given state-action pair requires querying an expensive

               fusion. The first section presents four approaches developed to
               evaluate the prospective value of data in learning a good policy
               and discusses their performance, guarantees, and application.
               These approaches address the problem through the lenses of
               information theory, decision theory, the optimistic value gap,
               and learning from comparative feedback. We apply this last method
               to reinforcement learning from human feedback for the alignment
               of large language models. The second presents work which uses
               physical prior knowledge about the dynamics to more quickly learn
               an accurate model. Finally, I give an introduction to the problem
               setting of nuclear fusion, present recent work optimizing the

               account limits on the maximum runaway current, the transported
               fraction of the heat loss and the current quench time. The aim is
               to explore the dependence of the cost function on injected
               densities, and provide insights into the behaviour of the
               disruption dynamics for representative scenarios. The simulations
               are conducted using the numerical framework Dream (Disruption

               the quantities of the material deposition, multi-megaampere

               neon is deposited at the edge region it leads to a significant
               reduction of both the final runaway current and the transported

               framework well suited for the interpretation of observed data
               given physics and probabilistic assumptions, also for very

               spatially-varying properties of the plasma (hot ionized gas where
               the fusion reactions take place). The spatial dependence of a
               plasma property, from the core to the edge of the plasma, is
               referred to as profile. Many control algorithms being developed
               require accurate, real-time knowledge of the plasma
               space-dependent state. However, many of the diagnostics used to
               measure the plasma state provide data that can be noisy or
               require significant post-processing. Within this context, an
               observer has been developed using an extended Kalman filtering
               approach for the electron temperature profile. The model employed
               by the observer uses a combination of analytical components and

               initial electron temperature profile and relatively high levels

               stellarator. Automatic observation and signaling of such events
               could help scientists to better understand these phenomena. With

               models and algorithms are a powerful tool to process the
               increasing amount of data. We investigate several classical
               supervised machine learning models to detect complete power
               detachment in the images captured by the Event Detection
               Intelligent Camera System (EDICAM) at the W7-X at each given

               despite its reduced contact with the machine walls and the
               radiation belt stays close to the separatrix, without exhibiting
               significant heat load onto the divertor. To decrease

               is a surrogate model based on a database of 3 \texttimes{} 108
               flux calculations of the quasilinear gyrokinetic transport model,
               QuaLiKiz. The database covers a wide range of realistic tokamak
               core parameters. Physical features such as the existence of a
               critical gradient for the onset of turbulent transport were
               integrated into the neural network training methodology. We have
               coupled QLKNN to the tokamak modeling framework JINTRAC and rapid
               control-oriented tokamak transport solver RAPTOR. The coupled
               frameworks are demonstrated and validated through application to

               operating space, predicting the turbulent transport of energy and
               particles in the plasma core. JINTRAC--QLKNN and RAPTOR--QLKNN

               profiles, but 3--5 orders of magnitude faster. Simulations which
               take hours are reduced down to only a few tens of seconds. The
               discrepancy in the final source-driven predicted profiles between
               QLKNN and QuaLiKiz is on the order of 1\%--15\%. Also the dynamic

               4\%--10\% compared to JINTRAC--QuaLiKiz observed at mid-radius,
               for a study of density buildup following the L--H transition.

               within these reactors2,3 is one of the most pressing
               challenges4,5, because disruptions can halt power production and
               damage key components. Disruptions are particularly harmful for
               large burning-plasma systems such as the multibillion-dollar
               International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project6
               currently under construction, which aims to be the first reactor
               that produces more power from fusion than is injected to heat the
               plasma. Here we present a method based on deep learning for
               forecasting disruptions. Our method extends considerably the
               capabilities of previous strategies such as
               first-principles-based5 and classical machine-learning7-11

               requirement for future large reactors that cannot afford training

               possibility of moving from passive disruption prediction to
               active reactor control and optimization. These initial results
               illustrate the potential for deep learning to accelerate progress

               fluctuations with a temporal window of size 128 $\mathrm{\mu}$s
               and generating a scalar output which can be interpreted as a
               probability of the upcoming ELM onset. As approximately labeled
               inter-ELM broadband ( 15 kHz $\leqslant{}$ f $\leqslant{}$ 150

               itself ELM-related precursors arising before the onsets through

                   sustainable nuclear fusion reactions here on Earth is a
                   tremendous scientific and technical challenge. Special

                   them to be economical. A significant bottleneck towards
                   applying more advanced control algorithms is the need for
                   better plasma simulation, where both physics-based and

                   learning (RL) promises improved flexibility to manage the
                   intricate and non-linear dynamics of the plasma encapsulated
                   in a tokamak. However, RL typically requires substantial
                   interaction with a simulator capable of accurately evolving
                   the high-dimensional plasma state. Compared to
                   first-principle-based simulators, whose intense computations
                   lead to sluggish RL training, we devise an effective method
                   to acquire a fully data-driven simulator, by mitigating the
                   arising compounding error issue due to the underlying

                   Machine learning (ML) prediction models have shown promise in

                   struggle in generalizing to the diverse characteristics and

                   across the world are also moving forward, such as EU-DEMO,
                   CFETR, SPARC and STEP. The high engineering complexity of a
                   tokamak makes it an extremely challenging device to optimise,
                   and test-based optimisation would be too slow and too costly.
                   Instead, digital design and optimisation must be favored,
                   which requires strongly-coupled suites of High-Performance
                   Computing calculations. In this context, having surrogate
                   models to provide quick estimates with uncertainty
                   quantification is essential to explore and optimise new
                   design options. Furthermore, these surrogates can in turn be
                   used to accelerate simulations in the first place. This is
                   the case of Parareal, a time-parallelisation method that can
                   speed-up large HPC simulations, where the coarse-solver can
                   be replaced by a surrogate. A novel framework,
                   Neural-Parareal, is developed to integrate the training of
                   neural operators dynamically as more data becomes available.
                   For a given input-parameter domain, as more simulations are
                   being run with Parareal, the large amount of data generated
                   by the algorithm is used to train new surrogate models to be
                   used as coarse-solvers for future Parareal simulations,
                   leading to progressively more accurate coarse-solvers, and
                   thus higher speed-up. It is found that such neural network
                   surrogates can be much more effective than traditional
                   coarse-solver in providing a speed-up with Parareal. This

                   intricate energy transfer processes within tokamaks. Our
                   methodology leverages Neural ODEs for the numerical
                   derivation of diffusivity parameters from DIII-D tokamak
                   experimental data, enabling the precise modeling of energy
                   interactions between electrons and ions across various
                   regions, including the core, edge, and scrape-off layer.
                   These regions are conceptualized as distinct nodes, capturing
                   the critical timescales of radiation and transport processes
                   essential for efficient tokamak operation. Validation against
                   DIII-D plasmas under various auxiliary heating conditions

                   optimisation of costly functions, using predictions from
                   Gaussian process models (GPs). In this work, we apply BO to
                   functions that exhibit invariance to a known group of
                   transformations. We show that vanilla and constrained BO
                   algorithms are inefficient when optimising such invariant
                   objectives, and provide a method for incorporating group
                   invariances into the kernel of the GP to produce
                   invariance-aware algorithms that achieve significant
                   improvements in sample efficiency. We derive a bound on the
                   maximum information gain of these invariant kernels, and
                   provide novel upper and lower bounds on the number of
                   observations required for invariance-aware BO algorithms to
                   achieve $\epsilon$-optimality. We demonstrate our method's
                   improved performance on a range of synthetic invariant and
                   quasi-invariant functions. We also apply our method in the
                   case where only some of the invariance is incorporated into
                   the kernel, and find that these kernels achieve similar gains
                   in sample efficiency at significantly reduced computational
                   cost. Finally, we use invariant BO to design a current drive
                   system for a nuclear fusion reactor, finding a
                   high-performance solution where non-invariant methods failed.",

               configuration to confine a hot plasma, is one of the most
               promising designs for developing reactors that can exploit
               nuclear fusion to generate electrical energy1,2. To reach the
               goal of an economical reactor, most tokamak reactor designs3-10
               simultaneously require reaching a plasma line-averaged density
               above an empirical limit-the so-called Greenwald density11-and
               attaining an energy confinement quality better than the standard
               high-confinement mode12,13. However, such an operating regime has
               never been verified in experiments. In addition, a long-standing
               challenge in the high-confinement mode has been the compatibility
               between a high-performance core and avoiding large, transient
               edge perturbations that can cause very high heat loads on the
               plasma-facing-components in tokamaks. Here we report the
               demonstration of stable tokamak plasmas with a line-averaged
               density approximately 20\% above the Greenwald density and an
               energy confinement quality of approximately 50\% better than the
               standard high-confinement mode, which was realized by taking
               advantage of the enhanced suppression of turbulent transport
               granted by high density-gradients in the high-poloidal-beta
               scenario14,15. Furthermore, our experimental results show an
               integration of very low edge transient perturbations with the
               high normalized density and confinement core. The operating
               regime we report supports some critical requirements in many
               fusion reactor designs all over the world and opens a potential
               avenue to an operating point for producing economically
               attractive fusion energy.",

               parameterization in the limit where some of the coefficients are

                 particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path
                 towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and
                 maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel.
                 This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop
                 control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by
                 the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma
                 configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously
                 undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design
                 that autonomously learns to command the full set of control
                 coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at
                 a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and
                 operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented
                 flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields
                 a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma
                 configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse
                 set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak {\`{a}}
                 Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional
                 shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative
                 triangularity and `snowflake' configurations. Our approach
                 achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape
                 for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained
                 `droplets' on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained
                 simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable
                 advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of
                 reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion
                 domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems
