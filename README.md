               framework for the construction of surrogate models capturing the
               spatiotemporal dynamics of 2D plasma turbulence. The proposed
               Generative Artificial Intelligence Turbulence (GAIT) framework
               enables the acceleration of turbulence simulations for long-time
               transport studies. GAIT leverages a convolutional variational

**Active ramp-down control and trajectory design for tokamaks with
               neural differential equations and reinforcement learning** - **2025** - *Wang, Allen M, Rea, Cristina, So, Oswin, Dawson, Charles, Garnier, Darren T, Fan, Chuchu* - journal - [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-025-02146-6) - The tokamak offers a promising path to fusion energy, but
               disruptions pose a major economic risk, motivating solutions to
               manage their consequence. This work develops a reinforcement
               learning approach to this problem by training a policy to
               ramp-down the plasma current while avoiding limits on a number of
               quantities correlated with disruptions. The policy training
               environment is a hybrid physics and mach... <!-- imported-from-bib -->

**Impact of model uncertainty on {SPARC} operating scenario
                   predictions with empirical modeling** - **2025** - *Saltzman, A, Rodriguez-Fernandez, P, Body, T, Ho, A, Howard, N T* - journal - [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09879) - Understanding and accounting for uncertainty helps to ensure
                   next-step tokamaks such as SPARC will robustly achieve their
                   goals. While traditional Plasma OPerating CONtour (POPCON)
                   analyses guide design, they often overlook the significant
                   impact of uncertainties in scaling laws, plasma profiles, and
                   impurity concentrations on performance predictions. This work
                   confronts these cha... <!-- imported-from-bib -->

               and plasma physics, as it enables the understanding of the
               distribution of fundamental plasma quantities within a reactor.
               Given that equilibrium reconstruction is an ill-posed problem, it
               is essential to constrain the algorithm with multiple diagnostics
               to achieve accurate results. Among these, the

                   neural network models trained on reduced input feature sets,
                   addressing an ill-posed task. Two models are compared: one
                   trained solely on coil currents and another incorporating
                   coil currents, plasma current, and loop voltage. The model

                   Barr, J, Orlov, D M* - journal - [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13267) - Precise control of plasma shape and position is essential for
                   stable tokamak operation and achieving commercial fusion
                   energy. Traditional control methods rely on equilibrium
                   reconstruction and linearized models, limiting adaptability
                   and real-time performance. Here,the first application of deep

                   the first time to construct a surrogate model for plasma
                   turbulence that enables long time transport simulations. The
                   proposed GAIT (Generative Artificial Intelligence Turbulence)
                   model is based on the coupling of a convolutional variational

               Oliver, Geiger, Benedikt, Henneberg, Sophia A* - journal - [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-4326/ad8017) - Abstract We present a semi-automated algorithm for designing
               three-dimensional divertor or limiter plates targeting low heat
               loads. The algorithm designs the plates in two stages: firstly,
               the parallel heat flux distribution is caught on
               vertically-inclined plates at one or several toroidal locations.
               Secondly, the power per unit area is reduced by stretching,
               tilting and bending the plates toroidally. H... <!-- imported-from-bib -->

                   high-dimensional datasets and making accurate predictions.
                   However, their intrinsic ``black-box'' nature makes it
                   difficult to interpret them or guarantee ``safe behavior''
                   when deployed in high-risk applications such as feedback

              fundamental research: in addition to the necessary progress in our
              theoretical knowledge, the operation of current tokamaks remains
              delicate, as it requires substantial human effort each time a new
              experimental scenario is developed. Moreover, the usual

               reactor, it is essential to maintain a high-pressure hydrogenic
               plasma without plasma disruption. Therefore, it is necessary to

                   Kolemen, Egemen, Schneider, Jeff* - journal - [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12416) - Although tokamaks are one of the most promising devices for
                   realizing nuclear fusion as an energy source, there are still
                   key obstacles when it comes to understanding the dynamics of
                   the plasma and controlling it. As such, it is crucial that
                   high quality models are developed to assist in overcoming
